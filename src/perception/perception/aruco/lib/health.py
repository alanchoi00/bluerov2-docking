"""Filter health classification.

Publishes a semantic status signal to downstream consumers (controllers,
state machines) so they can decide whether to trust the filter output.
This decouples them from the filter's internal representation they
subscribe to a health enum, not covariance values they'd have to threshold
themselves.

Starting thresholds are populated below; tune them against the
fine-alignment controller's safety envelope
